- Clone/download this repo to the proper plugin folder of your WordPress local server. Make sure to establish the upstream connection with the following command:
  ```
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/DigitalRiver/digital-river-global-commerce.git
  ```

- When everything is set up, login to admin page with the credentials you just created, navigate to "Plugins" page from the left menu, click the "Activate" button for **Digital River Global Commerce**

## ðŸš© Development

We use [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp) as our plugin build-workflow.


### Start developing and compiling code

- Start your npm build workflow by running the command below in plugin directory:
  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
  Now you can access live reload localhost by URL like this: http://localhost:3000/
- More npm/gulp tasks can be used:

  ```
  # To optimize images.
  gulp images

  # To generate WP POT translation file.
  gulp translate

  # To generate RTL stylesheets and Sourcemap.
  gulp stylesRTL

  # Run JS unit tests (Jest)
  npm run test:jest

  ```

- If you need to customize/add gulp tasks, please modify **gulpfile.babel.js**

## ðŸš© Testing
We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as unit testing framework for Javascript , [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for PHP unit testing, and [TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe) as our end-to-end testing framework.

### Write and run unit testing for Javascript
1. Write unit testing case under tests/jest/public/ with Jest.
2. Run unit testing for Javascript.
  ```
  npm run test:jest
  ```

### Write and run unit testing for PHP
1. Write unit testing case under tests/Unit-Test with phpunit.
2. Install PHPUnit and execute the scripts under tests/Unit-Test with PHPUnit.



### Install Testcafe for E2E testing
  ```
  npm install -g -y testcafe
  ```

### Write E2E testing script

Write E2E testing case under tests/Testcafe with Testcafe.

### Running the E2E testing

Then you can specify the [target browser](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/command-line-interface.html#browser-list) and [file path](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/command-line-interface.html#file-pathglob-pattern) to run the test with command like this:

  ```
  testcafe chrome test/Testcafe/fixtures
  ```

## ðŸš© Prepare your Pull Request
